# Portfolio-1
This project is for out portfolio 1 assignment:

Breaking it down, I added Two more components and 
styled them using a seperate css stylesheet imported 
into the App.js file. 

Component one added is <IndexTwo> which is another added text

Component Two added is <IndexThree> which is an imported image.
  
Each of these components are imported into the App.js file and styled 
 using pretty.css
